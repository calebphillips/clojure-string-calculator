# clojure-string-calculator

The intent of this project is to get the string calculator kata worked up in clojure so that I can have a quick exercise for building clojure chops.

Since I don't have any clojure experience, I am initially basing it on the solution by Tom Crayford in this video: http://vimeo.com/9350864.  The specs are based pretty closely on the ones from Corey Haines' ruby version of the kata.

I am using speclj instead of clojure-test, because I came across it on twitter this morning, and liked how quickly I was able to grok the examples.  The integration of lein also helped me get the project set up without having to worry about layout, dependencies, etc.
